## 📝 Overview
This study explores a novel approach to detecting and analyzing blood supply alterations in the nasal mucosa using computer vision and multispectral imaging. By applying advanced signal processing techniques, it aims to provide a quantitative method for evaluating pharmaceutical effects on mucosa tissue. Clinical trials demonstrated the system's effectiveness in objectively assessing these changes.

## 🎯 Research Goals & Contributions
- **Data Collection:** Conducted pilot measurements using a snapshot camera.
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Developed a method to assess mucosa tissue changes under pharmaceutical application.
- **Innovations:**
  - Created **2D Hemoglobin Oxygenation Dynamic graphs** for visualizing changes.
  - Proposed a dynamic model for mucosa alterations.
  - Designed a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for streamlined data processing.

### 📌 Features:
- Image processing for nasal mucosa analysis
- Blood supply detection using machine learning
- Computer vision techniques for medical applications
